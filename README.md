=========================

Olofsson: Audiovisual Programming - Digital Harmony

In this course we will try to unite realtime computer graphics with synthetic sound using the softwares [Unity](http://unity3d.com) and [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io). The goal is to try many different techniques and each week build a little interactive composition that explore the relation between image and sound.
The course will be will be taught in English and will be easier to follow with a bit of background in computer programming. Bring your own laptop.
